Redflag: An Entrance Exam for Data
==================================

    | 🚩 ``redflag`` aims to be an automatic safety net for
    | machine learning datasets. Given a ``DataFrame`` or
    | ``ndarray``, ``redflag`` will analyse each feature,
    | including aspects such as class imbalance, outliers,
    | anomalous data patterns, threats to the IID assumption,
    | and so on.

.. attention::
    This project is quite rough and does not do much yet.
    The API will very likely change without warning.
    If you think it might be useful, please consider
    helping to improve the project!
